### Introduction.

Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. Building this project is very important for you because:

* It's a real-world-like project, built with business specifications that will look really nice in your portfolio; and
* You will get feedback about the achievement of technical and soft skills gained during this section of the program.

Requirements [here](https://www.notion.so/Catalogue-of-Dog-Clothes-8bf1512b8ab34fa28848beb8ab698a32).


### Scenario Design

It is based on a catalogue of clothes for dogs. It is not a store itself because there are no payments or user authentication. It is just a catalogue, that is, a browsable list of items that you can filter and access to the details of one item. 

The webapp should have at least 2 types of pages:
- one page with a list of items that could be filtered by some parameters; in the example project, it's a list of dog clothes that can be filtered by category (hoodies & sweaters, bowties, etc.)
- one page for the item details; in this example, the product detail page (bowtie).

### Technical mandatory requirements of the project

1. The project is a single page application built with React and Redux
2. The data that was retrieved from the API should be stored in the Redux store
3. You should filter the data that you retrieve from the API using a Filter stateless component
4. Every page, the main page and pages for each item, should have a unique route within the SPA
5. The project should be deployed and accessible online
